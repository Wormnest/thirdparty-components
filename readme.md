Opensource thirdparty components
================================

This repository contains my forks of several open source components that
I'm using.
Compared to the originals they have been changed to my needs and where
needed bugs have been fixed.
Other bug fixes, comments and patches with new features are welcome.
However be aware that this is a hobby project of mine and I'm
still using Delphi 6. To be able to integrate your patches they will
need to be made compatible with Delphi 6.
Work has also started on making them compatible with Fpc/Lazarus.
Currently only Win32 is supported.

Overview of components
----------------------

1. ghostscript
--------------
A version of gsapi.pas which is an interface to the Ghostscript API
adapted to my needs.

2. twain-wilson
---------------
A twain api interface made by Colin Wilson with bugfixes by me and
further adapted to my needs.

3. ruler-zijlstra
-----------------
A ruler component made by Pieter Zijlstra. We use version 1.73 since
that version is working fine for our needs. However newer versions
are available from his website.
